# RAG Agent

RAG Agent is a research and development project around **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**.  
It combines a language model with an external knowledge base to improve the **quality and accuracy** of generated answers.  

The goal of this project is to build an **intelligent assistant** capable of:
- Indexing and searching within internal documents provided initially
- Allowing users to upload new documents and ask questions about them
- Generating contextual answers based on retrieved information (via embeddings and vector search)
- Offering an extensible foundation to integrate different models and data sources

> ğŸš€ Installation and usage instructions will be added soon.
